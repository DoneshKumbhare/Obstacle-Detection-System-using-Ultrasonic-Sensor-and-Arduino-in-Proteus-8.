# Obstacle-Detection-System-using-Ultrasonic-Sensor-and-Arduino-in-Proteus-8.
This project is an Obstacle Detection System designed and simulated using Proteus 8 Software and programmed through the Arduino IDE. The system uses an Ultrasonic Sensor to measure the distance of nearby obstacles and display the distance dynamically on an LCD screen.
